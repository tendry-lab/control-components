//! The 1-Wire bus system uses a single bus master to control one or more slave devices.
//!
//! @notes
//!  Key protocol considerations:
//!   - Master should follow the protocol transaction sequence:
//!      - Initialization.
//!      - Rom command, followed by any required data exchange.
//!      - Sensor Function Command, followed by any required data exchange.
//!   - All data and commands are transmitted least significant bit first.
//!   - One bit of data is transmitted over the bus per a single time slot.
//!   - All write time slots should be at least of 60 microseconds.
//!   - A recovery delay of at least 1 microsecond is used after each write time slot.
//!   - All read time slots should be at least of 60 microseconds.
//!   - A recovery delay of at least 1 microsecond is used after each read time slot.
